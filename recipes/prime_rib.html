    <h1>Prime Rib</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cow has 13 ribs on each side. Ribs six through 12 are classified as the "rib primal section." So prime rib refers to the bone-in roast from the rib primal section. Prime rib is sometimes also referred to as the "standing rib roast." But note that "prime" here doesn't refer to USDA Prime beef. More on that below.
